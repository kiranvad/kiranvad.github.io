I mentored a group of 5 students from the Materials Science and Engineering department for the [DIRECT-CAPSTONE project at UW](https://depts.washington.edu/uwdirect/). I have made the following (hand written) notes for them to provide a prime on [Riemannian geometry](http://kiranvad.github.io/files/teaching/capstone/riemannian_geometry.pdf) and [PCA](http://kiranvad.github.io/files/teaching/capstone/pca.pdf). I believe these are written to be as intuitive as possible and would be thrilled some of you find them useful as well.
