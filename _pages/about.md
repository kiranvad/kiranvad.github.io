I am a postdoc scholar in the [Department of Chemical Enginerring](https://www.cheme.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington, Seattle. I am also an affilitate at the [eScience Institute](https://escience.washington.edu/) as a *UW Data Science Postdoctoral Fellow* and have Co-chaired the weekly postdoc seminar series at the eScience (2021-2022). I have a Ph.D. in material science and engineering where my focus was on physics-based modeling and data-representations for accelerated material discover. Currenly, as a postdoc, I am working at the interface of Machine learning and Material Sciences with special focus on the relaization of autnoumous material discovery and design. Previously, I spent five wonderful years at the [Indian Institute of Technlogy Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) and obtained bachelors and masters from the department of Mechanical Engineering. 

## Research Interests

My main research interests are learning representations for data-efficient scientific discovery and understanding of physical phenomenon. Representations play key role in realizing the dream of autonomous experimental design using techniques such as active learning and reinforcement learning. I am interested in developing frameworks to understand materials based on their topology and (differential) geometry that are both computationally tractable and interpretable.

## Others
I am an ardent cricket fan and spend a lot of my free time watching, analyzing and writing about the beatiful game I've been watching for the better part of 20 years! I also watch a lot of Formula 1 which takes up most of my weekends during the season. I have keen interest in music (composing, production etc.,) and self-taught myself how to play a little bit of keyboard and typically enjoy A.R.Rahman, twenty-one-pilots, and Yanni.
