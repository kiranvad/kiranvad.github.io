I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Department of Chemical Engineering](https://www.cheme.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington, Seattle, and a *UW Data Science Postdoctoral Fellow* affiliated with the [eScience Institute](https://escience.washington.edu/). As part of my involvement with the data science community, I co-chaired the eScience Institute’s weekly postdoc seminar series (2021–2022).

My research lies at the intersection of **machine learning** and **materials science**, with a focus on building autonomous experimentation workflows for materials discovery and design. Broadly, I develop models and representations that bridge physical insight and data-driven methods to accelerate the discovery of soft materials and nanostructures. My Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering (University at Buffalo, SUNY) focused on developing physics-based and data-driven models for material optimization and structure–property mapping. I received my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/), with a specialization in thermal engineering.


### Research Interests

My core research interest is in **learning interpretable representations for data-efficient scientific discovery**, especially in settings where experimental data is expensive or sparse. I work on developing differentiable, geometry-inspired models that integrate active learning and reinforcement learning for autonomous experiment design. I am particularly interested in representations grounded in **topology and differential geometry** to make scientific workflows both computationally efficient and physically meaningful.


### Beyond Research

Outside the lab, I’m a passionate follower of **cricket** and have been watching, analyzing, and writing about the game for over two decades. I also enjoy **Formula 1**—my weekends are often booked during the race season. I dabble in music production and play a bit of keyboard, with musical tastes ranging from **A. R. Rahman** to **twenty one pilots** and **Yanni**.
